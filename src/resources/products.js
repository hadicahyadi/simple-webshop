    longDescription: "After multiple iterations and prototypes, our focus was accuracy and fit. Because of the primarily digital nature of this helmet, the conventional overhead entry couldn't be used without losing the accuracy of sculpt. Instead, we engineered a system of faceplate removal which will allow our costumers and collectors to easily slip the helmet on and reattach the faceplate, capturing the original intent and curvatures from the digital models."
